# NexaCargo - Global Logistics Website 🚢

A premium, fully responsive static frontend website for **NexaCargo**, a global logistics and shipping provider. This project was built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS** to demonstrate high-end UI/UX design and functional frontend logic for a logistics business.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a **Frontend Internship Assignment**. 
**Objective:** To design a professional, static React-based website for a cargo service that showcases frontend skills, responsive design, and practical features like real-time tracking mockups and a WhatsApp-based quote request system.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Responsive Design:** A seamless experience across Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile devices using Tailwind's mobile-first approach.
* **Hero Section:** An impactful landing area featuring a bold "Global Logistics Simplified" tagline and a call-to-action button linked to services.
* **Company Profile (About Us):** A dedicated section highlighting the company’s history since 1998, a fleet size of 1,200+, and a commitment to timely delivery.
* **Shipping Menu (Services):** An interactive grid displaying 6–8 shipping categories (Air, Ocean, Land, etc.) with representative imagery and sample pricing.
* **Operational Features:** Showcases core capabilities including a **Real-time Tracking Mock UI**, Secure Packaging, and 24/7 Custom Support.
* **Fleet Gallery:** A clean image grid featuring high-quality visuals of the global transport fleet with hover-based info overlays.
* **WhatsApp Order System:** A functional form where users input their name, package type, and quantity. Submitting the form opens a pre-filled WhatsApp message formatted as: *"Hi, I'm [Name], I want to ship [Package] of [Quantity]"*.
* **Professional Navigation:** Dynamic Navbar that transitions from transparent on the Home page to solid on other routes using `react-router-dom`.
